He is friendly, easy to get along with, well-liked by our clients and respected by his co-workers. Forever the student, Satish takes courses frequently to stay up-to-date on the latest techniques in software development. He is able to thoroughly focus on every project and is not easily distracted. He comprehends instructions quickly and is flexible when changes have to be made in the original plan. Satish is a skillful communicator both written and verbal and works extremely well with our clients, some of whom request him specifically to handle their jobs. Satish is dedicated to providing quality work. He checks and rechecks his software before turning it in for presentation to the client. He strives to make his programs as user friendly as possible understanding that not everyone is an expert programmer. He is detail oriented and rarely has any bugs in his finished product. His energy is limitless and his enthusiasm serves to motivate everyone on his team. I am sure he will succeed wherever he goes."
